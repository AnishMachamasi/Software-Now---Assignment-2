## üß† Assignment Questions

### ‚úÖ Question 1 - Text File Encryption

**Objective:**  
Read from `raw_text.txt`, encrypt the text using custom logic, write to `encrypted_text.txt`, and include functions to decrypt and verify correctness.

**Encryption Rules:**

- Takes two user inputs: `n` and `m`.

#### Rules:
- Lowercase letters:
  - `a-m`: shift **forward** by `n * m`
  - `n-z`: shift **backward** by `n + m`
- Uppercase letters:
  - `A-M`: shift **backward** by `n`
  - `N-Z`: shift **forward** by `m^2`
- All other characters (digits, symbols, etc.) remain **unchanged**.

#### Example

##### Input
- Enter value for n: 2
- Enter value for m: 3

##### Output

##### Contents of `raw_text.txt`:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog beneath the shady willows. The dog, startled from his peaceful afternoon nap, quickly rises and chases after the mischievous fox. Through vibrant meadows and past buzzing beehives they race, disturbing a flock of quails that scatter into the crisp autumn sky. The fox, quite pleased with his clever prank, dashes into his cozy underground den while the dog, now exhausted from the zealous pursuit, returns to his favorite spot under the whispering branches to resume his quiet slumber.

##### Result

- ‚úÖ Decryption is correct!


### üìä Question 2 - Weather Data Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze temperature data stored in multiple CSV files (one per year) inside the `temperatures/` folder.

#### Tasks:
- Calculate **average seasonal temperatures** and save to `average_temp.txt`.
- Identify the station(s) with the **largest temperature range** and save to `largest_temp_range_station.txt`.
- Find the **warmest and coolest station(s)** and save to `warmest_and_coolest_station.txt`.

### üå≥ Question 3 - Recursive Tree Pattern with Turtle

**Objective:**  
Draw a tree using recursive turtle graphics.

#### User Inputs:
- Left and Right Branch Angles
- Starting Branch Length
- Recursion Depth
- Branch Length Reduction Factor

#### Example:
- Left Angle: `20¬∞`
- Right Angle: `25¬∞`
- Start Length: `100 px`
- Depth: `5`
- Reduction Factor: `0.7`

#### Output:
